F5 NGINX Kubernetes Traffic Management
======================================

**Objective**: 

Take your  Kubernetes  clusters  into production  with  confidence-and keep them  there  easily with  proven,  industry-leading  NGINX  technology  trusted  by many  customers  around  the world.  Protect and secure  your  modern  apps across hybrid,  multi-cloud  environments,  while  delivering higher  levels  of reliability,  visibility, scalability,  and performance,  with best-in-class  Kubernetes traffic management  solution  from  NGINX.

**Why**: 

Kubernetes, by default, does not provide necessary advanced layer 7 load balancing services, path-based service routing, encryption, authentication, or rate limiting to securely and flexibly  expose its applications to external environments. Additionally,  at production scale, the challenges and complexity of managing routing and securing traffic into a Kubernetes cluster is a pervasive threat to application and mission success.

The NGINX  solution reduces complexity and provides highly scalable advanced traffic management, visibility,  and built-in  security for your Kubernetes infrastructure.
