Create a Diagram
================

**Outcome**: Visualize your cloud deployment using a diagram 

Elements that should be included in your visualization:
    *. Cloud network (Subnets, GW, etc.)
    *. Clients connecting to your app 
    *. Other components which are critical for the deployment 

**Why**: Having a visual representation of your deployment makes it easier to explain concepts and any proposed architecture/solution 

**How**: LucidChart is available through the applications portal.
