Create a Diagram
================

**Outcome**: Visualize your cloud deployment using a diagram 

Elements that should be included in your visualization:
  - Cloud network (Subnets, Gateways, etc.)
  - Clients connecting to your app 
  - Other components which are critical for the deployment 

**Why**: Having a visual representation of your deployment makes it easier to explain concepts and any proposed architecture/solutions

**How**: LucidChart is available through the applications portal.
