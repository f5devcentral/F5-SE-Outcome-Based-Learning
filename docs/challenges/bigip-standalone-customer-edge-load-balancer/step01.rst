Build a BIG-IP standalone in the Cloud
======================================

**Objective**:

Build a BIG-IP standalone in the Cloud.

Use three interfaces: 

  - Management interface
  - Public Interface 
  - Internal interface

**Why**:

Customers are on their Cloud journey and will ask how to deploy a BIG-IP in the cloud.

The deployment of a BIG-IP in a public cloud is different than on-prem or with physical devices.
The goal is to make you familiar with the deployment mechanics in the public cloud.

Deploy the BIG-IP in the base cloud environment.

**How**:

Chose your cloud provider and start with the documentation below.

AWS:

Azure:

Google Cloud: 

- https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/google_index.html

Other Clouds:

It is your choice to use the F5-offered automation templates, or do deploy them by hand. A step-by-step standalone deployment is recommended but optional.
