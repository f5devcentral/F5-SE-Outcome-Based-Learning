F5XC Regional Edge WAAP
=======================

**Introduction**
The Internet is much like water, on one hand, an amazing thing that provides life/capability for so much, but on the other hand, can be the most destructive force in nature. 
Large numbers of users, large size and/or several resources on pages, malicious activity, the site slowing down the further away it is, or events triggering massive spikes in traffic are only a few of the problems F5 Distributed Cloud addresses.
This challenge-based exercise is intended to teach you how to evolve your application into a globally accelerated, protected website.

**Learning Objectives**
In this exercise you will be solving the following common problems using XC (RE only, all services are F5 hosted):

- Securely expose your website with SSL encryption and a DNS name
