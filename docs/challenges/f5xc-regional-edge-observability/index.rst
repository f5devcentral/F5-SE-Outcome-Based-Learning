  About SSL Labs

  SSL Labs is a collection of documents, tools and thoughts related to SSL. It's an attempt to better understand how SSL is deployed, and an attempt to make it better. I hope that, in time, SSL Labs will grow into a forum where SSL will be discussed and improved.

  SSL Labs is a non-commercial research effort, and we welcome participation from any individual and organization interested in SSL.
