Build a BIG-IP HA Cluster in the Cloud
======================================

**Objective**:

Build a BIG-IP HA Cluster in the Cloud.

Use three interfaces: 

  - Managemenet interface
  - Public Interface 
  - Internal interface

**Why**:

Customers are on their cloud journey and will ask how to best deploy an BIG-IP HA Cluster in the cloud.

The deployment of an BIG-IP Cluster in public cloud is different than on prem or with physical devices.
The goal is to make you familiar with the deployment mechanics in public cloud.

Deploy the BIG-IP HA Cluster in the base cloud environment.

**How**:

Chose your cloud provider and start with the documentation below.

AWS:

- https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/aws_index.html

Azure:

- https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure_index.html 

Google Cloud: 

- https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/google_index.html

Other Clouds:

It is your choise to use the F5 offered automation templates, or do deploy them by hand. A step by step stadalone deployment with subsequent Cloud Failover extension installation is recomended but optional.
