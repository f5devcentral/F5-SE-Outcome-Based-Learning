Step 2
============================

**Objective**:

Verify Failover works

**Why**:

After the BIG-IP Cluster was created and the juice shop app is exposed, check if the failover works.

**How**:

Trigger a failover and verify that the remaining device handles traffic.

Ask yourself:

- How did you trigger the failover?
- Is there an another way to trigger the failover?
- If so, did it work or did the alternative way not trigger the failover? If so, why?
