Welcome to the F5 SE Outcome-based Learning
=============================================

|image01|

F5 provides many layers of learning, crafted blueprints, Agility, and in-person events. The SE Outcome-based learning is different from those. These learning solutions are designed around building confidence and knowledge. Unlike other learning solutions the outcome of a task is defined, and only example documentation is provided. 

About outcomes-based education:

Outcome-based education or outcomes-based education (OBE) is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE; instead, classes, opportunities, and assessments should all help students achieve the specified outcomes.

Challenges are meant to be run independently of each other, eventually creating a lab/demo environment able to sustain multiple solutions. Each challenge will refer to the required base or base plus an optional environment as needed.

The estimated completion time of each challenge is up to 2 hours.
