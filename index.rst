Welcome to the F5 SE Objective-based Learning
=============================================

|image01|

F5 provides many layers of learning, crafted blueprints, Agility, and in-person events. The SE Objective-based learning is different from those. These learning solutions are designed around building confidence and knowledge. Unlike other learning solutions the outcome of a task is defined, and only example documentation is provided. 

About outcomes-based education:

Outcome-based education or outcomes-based education (OBE) is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). By the end of the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE; instead, classes, opportunities, and assessments should all help students achieve the specified outcomes.
